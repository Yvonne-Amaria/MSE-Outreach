## How to contribute

First, checkout a branch for your changes. You can call this whatever you want, preferably something relevant to what section you're editing. For example, if I (Gillian) am updating the battery_lab section, I might call my branch "GJ_battery"

```sh
git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
```
Set your upstream for the branch

```sh
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<BRANCH_NAME>  <BRANCH_NAME>
```
Now, push your branch to the remote repository.

```sh
git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH_NAME>
```

Make your wonderful changes however you see fit, then stage, commit your changes, and push again to the remote. Please commit your edits with a meaningful message! 

```sh
git add .
git commmit -m "I added X, Y, and Z to the <SECTION> section"
git push
```

Once you've pushed, pull the latest changes from main and rebase your changes to `main`

```sh
git checkout main 
git pull
```
```sh
git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>
git rebase main <BRANCH_NAME>
```
Once you've done this 

Once your branch has been used to commit changes, you can delete it

```sh
git branch -D <BRANCH_NAME>
```

NOTE -  make sure you are regularly pulling changes from `main` to keep your local repository updated!!
